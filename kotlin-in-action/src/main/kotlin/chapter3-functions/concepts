- triple quote strings in Kotlin, you dont really need escape characters.
- they can be multiline as well.

"//".toRegex() - you have regular expression}
otherwise any string passed to split function is considered as normal string
In Java, split method takes regular expression.

Kotlin also provides extension functions such as - substringBeforeLast, substringAfterLast(".")
to avoid writing complex regular expressions.
