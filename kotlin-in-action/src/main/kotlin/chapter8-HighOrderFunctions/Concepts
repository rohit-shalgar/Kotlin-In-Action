Function types are lambdas with paranthesis and with a return type.

example - (Int,Int) -> Int = {x+y}
           ()-> Unit = {// void operation}

lambda expressions are compiled into anonymous classes.
    if lambda expressions need to compiled again due to value changes then
    the anonymous classes will be computed over and over

inline keyword prevents that by injecting the code as it is wherever it is used.
